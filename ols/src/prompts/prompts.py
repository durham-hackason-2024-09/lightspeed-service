# Note::
# Right now templates are somewhat alligned to make granite work better.
# GPT still works well with this. Ideally we should have model specific tags.
# For history we can laverage ChatPromptTemplate from langchain,
# but that is not done as granite was adding role tags like `Human:` in the response.
# With PromptTemplate, we have more control how we want to structure the prompt.
